#**Election_Analysis**
## The Colorado Board of Elections has tasked me to complete an election audit.
To complete this I had to start with a list of tasks to complete to prepare:

 - [x] Calculate total number of votes cast
 
 - [x] Get a list on participating candidates
 
 - [x] Loop through the data to determine how many votes each candidate received
 
 - [x] Based off  _total number of votes_ and _votes per candidate_ , I determined the percentage won for each candidate.
 
 - [x] Comparing the total votes and percentages won, I completed my election audit by presenting the winner of the popular vote. 
 - [x] After completing the candidate list - I analyized the data further to determine county turnout. 
 - [x] Analyizing county data required determining the total votes per county and percentage of votes to show which county had the higher turn out rate.
